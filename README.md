# Mancala-AI
An AI that plays the game of Mancala against a human player

Rules:

Mancala is a 2 player game that consists of a board with 12 'cups' (6 for each player) filled with 4 stones each as well as 2 score cups, (1 for each player). The object of the game is to drop the most stones into your score cup.

1. Each turn you choose a number 1-6 to represent which 'cup' you will empty
2. Once you have chosen a cup, it will be emptied and its stones will be dropped one by one into the next cups going counter-clockwise
3. This means you will place stones in your own cups, your score cup, and the opponents score cup
4. You do not, however, place stones in the opponents score cup.
5. If the last stone you drop is in your score cup, you get another turn
6. If the last stone you drop is in an empty cup on your side and there's stones in the opposite cup on the opponents side, you place that last stone and all stones in the opposite opponent cup into your score cup
7. Once all the stones on one player's side are gone, the game is over!
8. Whichever player has the most stones in their score cup at that time wins.
